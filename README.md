# My Eudyptula Challenge journey
This repository is intended to be the public collection of my solutions to
each of the tasks in the [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/
"The Eudyptula Challenge").

From the Challenge's webpage:
> The Eudyptula Challenge is a series of programming exercises for the Linux
> kernel, that start from a very basic "Hello world" kernel module, moving on
> up in complexity to getting patches accepted into the main Linux kernel
> source tree.

In keeping with the spirit of the Challenge, and also its rules, I shall
abstain from posting answers to the tasks online while I'm still a participant.
I shall, however, post the task descriptions as and when I get new tasks, just
to keep track of when I began and ended individual tasks.
