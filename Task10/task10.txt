This is Task 10 of the Eudyptula Challenge
------------------------------------------

Yeah, you conquered the sysfs monster, great job!

Now you know you'll never want to mess with a kobject again, right?
Trust me, there are easier ways to create sysfs files, and we will get
into that for a future task, but for now, let's make it a bit more
simple after all of that coding.

For these tasks, go back to the linux-next tree you used for task 07.
Update it, and then do the following:
  - Create a patch that fixes one coding style problem in any of the
    files in drivers/staging/
  - Make sure the patch is correct by running it through
    scripts/checkpatch.pl
  - Submit the code to the maintainer of the driver/subsystem, finding
    the proper name and mailing lists to send it to by running the tool,
    scripts/get_maintainer.pl on your patch.
  - Get the patch accepted into the subsystem maintainers git tree.
  - Send a web link back to me of your patch in the public mailing list
    archive (don't cc: me on the patch, that will only confuse me and
    everyone in the kernel development community) as well as a pointer
    to the git commit of your patch in the subsystem tree.

Hopefully this patch will be accepted into the kernel tree, and all of a
sudden, you are an "official" kernel developer!

Don't worry, there's plenty more tasks coming, but a little breather
every now and again for something simple is always nice to have.
